# Come-Come

## Who doesn't like a little retro game?

This project was born in our *Data Structure and Algorithms* class at the **Federal University of Bahia** (*UFBA*). We were in our second period at University.

The teacher asked for a little **Pac-Man** game, using knowledge gained through the class subject. But after some days (a month or so) and class problems, this homework project was cancelled.

As we were happy with the project initial idea we decided to keep the project, like a fun hobbie, during the semester.

## The name

**Pac-Man** loves to eat some fruits and ghosts during the game, he just does it. So we decided to call him ***Come-Come*** (like *eat-eat* in english) because he just eat and eat and eat...

That is the name we used to hear while we were children, and we love it.
